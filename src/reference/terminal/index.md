# Terminal

::: tip Introduction
Terminal reference for everyday use of for the occasional use not yet in muscle memory. Most of this reference refers
to MacOS given that is my primary OS and I have less and less of a need to login to Linux servers given greater use
of Serverless these days. Most of this should be applicable to Linux as well but MacOS has its own flavor at times.
