    <p class="my-4 text-[#2c3e50]">Terminal reference for everyday use of for the occasional use not yet in muscle
      memory. Most of this reference refers to MacOS given that is my primary OS and I have less and less of a need to
      login to Linux servers given greater use of Serverless these days. Most of this should be applicable to Linux as
      well but MacOS has its own flavor at times.</p>
