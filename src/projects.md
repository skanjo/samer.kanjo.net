# Projects

## This site
The site is being built with my bare hands using <a href="https://11ty.dev/" target="_blank">11ty</a>, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>, and source available on <a href="https://github.com/skanjo/samer.kanjo.net/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

## kill-vertx
In the past I used <a href="https://vertx.io/" target="_blank">Vert.x</a> to build high performance edge servers. This project was intended to find the best way to properly shutdown a Vert.x application. The project is available on <a href="https://github.com/skanjo/kill-vertx" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. This project is getting a bit old, last commit was back in 2017.

## HIPS
The project was an interview homework assignment orignally developed in Java. Later I implemented this project in Clojure, my first Clojure project. Probably not the best Clojure and I am sure I would make some changes now, the thing I like about the Clojure version was implementing a multi-mobule project using Leiningen. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/skanjo/hips-java" target="_blank">Java</a> version and <a href="https://github.com/skanjo/hips-clj" target="_blank">Clojure</a> verion on GitHub.
