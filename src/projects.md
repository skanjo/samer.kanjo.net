# Projects

## This site

The site is built with my bare hands using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com),
and [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev) hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), and source available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/skanjo/samer.kanjo.net). Discuss content with me on [Bluesky]({{ site.author.bluesky }}).

## kill-vertx

In the past I used [Vert.x](https://vertx.io) to build high performance edge servers. This project was intended to find
the best way to properly shutdown a Vert.x application. The project is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/skanjo/kill-vertx).

## HIPS

The project was an interview homework assignment originally developed in Java. Later I implemented this project in
Clojure, my first Clojure project. Probably not the best Clojure and I am sure I would make some changes now, the thing
I like about the Clojure version was implementing a multi-module project using [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org). You
can find the [Java](https://github.com/skanjo/hips-java) version and [Clojure](https://github.com/skanjo/hips-clj)
version on GitHub.
