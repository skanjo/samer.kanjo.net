# Projects

## This site
The site is built with my bare hands using <a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/" target="_blank">VuePress</a>, hosted on
<a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>, and source available on
<a href="https://github.com/skanjo/samer.kanjo.net/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

## kill-vertx
In the past I used <a href="https://vertx.io/" target="_blank">Vert.x</a> to build high performance edge servers. This
project was intended to find the best way to properly shutdown a Vert.x application. The project is available on
<a href="https://github.com/skanjo/kill-vertx" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. This project is getting a bit old, last
commit was back in 2017.

## HIPS
The project was an interview homework assignment originally developed in Java. Later I implemented this project in
Clojure, my first Clojure project. Probably not the best Clojure and I am sure I would make some changes now, the thing
I like about the Clojure version was implementing a multi-mobule project using Leiningen. You can find the
<a href="https://github.com/skanjo/hips-java" target="_blank">Java</a> version and
<a href="https://github.com/skanjo/hips-clj" target="_blank">Clojure</a> version on GitHub.
